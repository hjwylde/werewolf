The dead are feared among the living; the dead outnumber the living. In most villages the dead remain that way, but not when the Necromancer is present. The Necromancer devoted their life to learning black magic and methods of bringing people back to life. Unfortunately this art is hard to perfect and all they can manage to bring back are soulless Zombies.
