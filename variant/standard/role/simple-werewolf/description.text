The Simple Werewolf is a fearsome lupine, cunning like no other creature that roams the forest. Their origin is unknown, but that matters little, for they present a grave threat to Fougères. While each day they hide in plain sight as an ordinary Villager, each night they transform and devour an innocent. There is little hope left for the village.
