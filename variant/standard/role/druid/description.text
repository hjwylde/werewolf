How honoured we are to be in the presence of such a noble leader. The return of the Druid marks an exceptional time in Fougères's history! Friend of the woodland creatures, practiced philosopher and now, with the help of Ferina their companion, a bane to the Werewolves themselves! My does she have a nose on her, strong enough to sniff out lycanthropes in close proximity! Listen for her grunt and heed her warning for she will not let you down.
