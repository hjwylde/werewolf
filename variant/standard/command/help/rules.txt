Each player is informed of their role (see `help roles` for a list) at the start of the game.
Each night, the Werewolves transform and subsequently assault and devour one Villager. After feasting, their lycanthropic form subsides and they once again hide in plain sight.
Each day, after discovering the victim, the village gathers in the town square. In a democratic fashion they then vote for whom they believe to be a Werewolf. The votee is immediately tied to a pyre and burned alive in an attempt to rid Fougères of all lupines.
